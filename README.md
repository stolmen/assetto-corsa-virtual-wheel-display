# Virtual Wheel

This is a Python widget for Assetto Corsa that renders an iRacing-esque virtual wheel that really should've been shipped with the game. I find it useful for replay analysis.

## Installation
Installation steps are no different to installing any other Python widget.

1. Copy the directory `virtualwheel` to `GAME_DIRECTORY/apps` 
2. Enable this plugin in game settings
3. Enter a session
4. Select `Virtual Wheel` from the widget list
5. Profit???
